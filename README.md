Hi all,

I'm a toon enthusiast and was sick of copy/paste/rename "character-53.ini's" manually. So I made an app for that.

Please copy the "pyinstalled" (or downloaded) .exe into your LotM folder (default --> C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Electronic Arts\Dark Age of Camelot\LotM") for it to work.

How to use:
- Create new character
- Once back in the character selection screen, run the .exe
- Fill in/select the needed input and the name of the character you've just created
- Click "Copy UI"
- Click "Play" on your new toon/character
- Enjoy your UI without fumbling around like a Dementia-Vamp debuffed caster in the LotM folder

This should work for every freeshard too, if you chose the Ywain-server option with the correct "-**.ini" number-ending. You can check this for existing characters in the LotM folder or in the app itself.

Have a great time playing, cheers :)
